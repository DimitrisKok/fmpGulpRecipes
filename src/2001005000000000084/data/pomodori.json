The user has had the opportunity to enter it twice before reaching that stage, which seems plenty enough to me...','','At that stage, the Smart Coupon plugin does not know to update the list of shipping methods (both on adding a freeshipping option, and upon removing it). But also,  I just did a test where I entered 4 addresses, two of which were in the restricted zone ( Alaska and Hawaii), and for a $80 order, I got free delivery to 4 addresses.  That\'s a pretty good deal, but is it really what we want?  It seems like there isn\'t enough business logic in the way we handle free shipping.','','I suggest\:','1) Removing the ability to add/remove coupons from the order/shipping confirmation page','2) Delve deeper into the Shipping Tables Plugin functionalities and see how to implement better business logic with what is available, unless you\'ve already covered the whole thing.','3) Improve the UI a bit in terms of data entry for the addresses.  I found it a bit confusing. ( The fact that you need to scroll down to find the additional address section(s), and also the section title of each, which reads \"CountryÂ¶United States\", could be more informative and tell us we\'are editing address 1/3, ie. )  I think that usability would benefit from these little tweaks.','','Let me know what you think of all this.
